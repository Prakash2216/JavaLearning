Immutable Class/Object
---------------------------
Immutable class is good for caching purpose because we don't have to be worry about of value changes and another benefit of immutable classes is that
its inherently thread-safe.

Steps to create Immutable class
---------------------------------
	1. Create class as final so that class can't be extended.
	2. Declare all the fields as private so that direct access is not allowed.
	3. Do not provide setter methods for variables.
	4. Make all mutable fields as final so that its can assigned only once.
	5. Initialize all the variables in constructor by performing deep cloning.
	6. Clone the object in getter method and return cloned object instead of actual object.
